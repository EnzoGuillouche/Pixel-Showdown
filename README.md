# Pixel Showdown

This game project has been started as a worshop in C++ courses, endorsed by Alan at ALGOSUP.<br>
The game deals with a Smash Bros like: 2D versus fighting game with platforms. We could play with 2 players (1v1).
Although, this game deals with life bars, not percentage. 3 lives are available, and if your opponent doesn't have any lives left, you win!
